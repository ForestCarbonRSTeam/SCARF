Algorithm for Spatial Mismatch and Systematic Prediction Error Corrected cAscade Random Forests (SCARF) using Landsat time series. Please contact Yingchun Fu (2022010182@m.scnu.edu.cn or fuyc@m.scnu.edu.cn) at School of Geography, South China Normal University if you have any questions.

The code contains two files, SCARF_SLR.R and BC_SLR.R. Instructions for use are given below:

Step 1: Pack and download the code locally;

Step 2: Use R to run SCARF_SLR.R, which is the main code of the code;

Note: BC_SLR.R contains the algorithm code that SCARF_SLR.R needs to call, please put it in the same directory with SCARF_SLR.R file. 

It is a draft version and the clean version code and data will be updated at soon.
